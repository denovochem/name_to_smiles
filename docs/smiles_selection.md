When different resolvers disagree on the SMILES for a given compound, the SMILES selection method will be used to determine the "best" SMILES. The desired selection method can be set by passing the following arguments to smiles_selection_mode (Default: 'weighted'):

- 'consensus': Pick the SMILES string returned by the most resolvers. Tie-breaker: lexicographical order.
- 'ordered': Pick the first SMILES that was generated by a resolver with the highest priority. The order of the resolvers provided as the resolvers_list argument in resolve_compounds_to_smiles determines the priority (highest to lowest).
- 'weighted': Assign weights to resolvers. Sum weights per SMILES. Pick highest total. Custom weights can be assigned at resolver initialization. See [Resolvers](resolvers.md) for default weights.
- 'rdkit_standardized': Pick the SMILES that is most standardized by RDKit. Penalizes compounds with more fragments, formal charges, radicals, and isotopes.
- 'fewest_fragments': Pick the smiles with the fewest fragments (separated by '.')
- 'longest_smiles': Pick the longest SMILES.
- 'shorted_smiles': Pick the shortest SMILES.
- 'random': Pick a random SMILES.

### Custom SMILES selection functions
smiles_selection_mode, in addition to taking any of the above arguments, can also take a function as an input. For example:
```
from placeholder_name.main import resolve_compounds_to_smiles
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

def reverse_alphabetical(smiles_dict: Dict[str, List[str]], **kwargs) -> Tuple[str, List[str]]:
    smiles = sorted(smiles_dict.keys())[-1]
    return smiles, smiles_dict[smiles]

resolved_smiles = resolve_compounds_to_smiles(['aspirin'], smiles_selection_mode=reverse_alphabetical)
```
